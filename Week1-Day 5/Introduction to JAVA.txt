 
Token:
	 individual or small blocks of a program are known as token
Types of tokens:-
1.keywords:
	 predefined words used for specific functions , it should be in lowercase only(ex. float, do, while)
2.Identifiers:
	 identifiers are the names given by the user for objects, classes,etc 
			  a)They must not begin with digit
                          b) Keywords cannot be used as identifiers
                          c)whitespace characters are also not allowed
3.Literals:
	 constant elements like9.9,100
4.Operaters: 
   -->Primitive(pre defined)
           a.byte(1 byte)
           b.short(2 bytes)
           c.int(4 bytes)
           d.long(8 byte)
           e.float(4 byte)
           f.double(8 byte)
           g.boolean(1 bit)
           h.character(2 bytes)


     -->Non-primitive(user defined)
            a.string
            b.array
5.Special symbols like (),{​​​​​​​}​​​​​​​,[],;


Naming Conventions:
     for package word should be in small letter
     for class and interface word start with capital letter
     for variable and method starting word should be small second word with starting capital letter (ex:readLine())
     for constants word start with capital letter
     for keywords word start with small letter

*Tokens: Smallest individual unit of a program that are recognized by the compiler.
1.keywords:words have a standard meaning or predefined meaning
  > all keywords are in lowercase letter and no space blw word.
2.identifiers:this are the user defined name that are given for class,method,objects.


  *identifier 4 rules:
   >They can have alphabets, digits, underscore and dollar symbol
   >They must not begin with digit
   >Keywords cannot be used as identifiers
   >whitespace characters are also not allowed
3.literals: constant values in the prgm.
4.operators:it is a symbol that is used to perform certain operations.
5.special symbols:like (),[],{​​​​​​​}​​​​​​​,...
  
* Naming conventions:
> packages in java are written in a small letters 
> class names & interface are start with capital letters.
>variable and method name first word in small letter and from second word in capital letter like:readLine().
  
*Data Types
1.primitive
 i)numerical:
  a)integer-->byte,short,int,long
  b)floating point--> float,double
 ii)non-numerical
  a)boolean-->true or false
  b)char-->"a"
2.non-primitive
 a)string
 b)arrays
 c)user defined classes
